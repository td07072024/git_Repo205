Head of a grey parrot
The grey parrot is medium to large sized, predominantly grey and black-billed. Its typical weight is 400 g (14 oz), with an approximate length of 33 cm (13 in),[8] and a wingspan of 46–52 cm (18–20+1⁄2 in).[9] The head and wings are generally darker than the body. The head and body feathers have slight white edges; the tail feathers are red.

Both sexes appear similar.[8] Juvenile colouration is similar to that of adults, but typically their eyes are dark grey to black, compared to the adults' yellow irises around dark pupils,[10] and their undertail coverts are tinged with grey.[8] Adults weigh 418–526 g (14+3⁄4–18+1⁄2 oz).[11]

Grey parrots may live for 40–60 years in captivity, although their mean lifespan in the wild appears to be shorter — approximately 23 years. They start breeding at an age of 3–5 years and lay 3–5 eggs per brood.
