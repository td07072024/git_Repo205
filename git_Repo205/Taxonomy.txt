The grey parrot was formally described in 1758 by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae. He placed it with all other parrots in the genus Psittacus and coined the binomial name Psittacus erithacus.[3] Linnaeus erroneously specified the type locality as "Guinea": the locality was later designated as Ghana in West Africa.[4] The genus name is Latin for "parrot". The specific epithet erithacus is Latin and is derived from the Ancient Greek εριθακος (erithakos) for an unknown bird that was said to mimic human sounds, perhaps the black redstart.[5]

The species is monotypic; no subspecies are accepted.[6] The Timneh parrot was formerly treated as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but is now considered a separate species based mainly on results from a genetic and morphological study published in 2007.[7][6] Although Linnaeus placed all the parrots known to him in the genus Psittacus, only the grey parrot and the Timneh parrot are now assigned to this genus.[3]

The Clements Checklist classifies the Príncipe grey parrot as a subspecies of the grey parrot. It therefore recognises two subspecies:

P. e. erithacus Linnaeus, 1758–Ivory Coast to Kenya, Tanzania, Príncipe, São Tomé, and Bioko
Príncipe grey parrot (P. e. principe) Alexander, 1909 – Príncipe, an island off the west coast of Africa
This is in contrast to the IOC, which instead classifies it as a subspecies of the Timneh parrot.
